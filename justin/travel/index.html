<h1>My travels between graduation and my first job</h1>
I was fortunate enough to have about 7 months to travel. This is how I spent it.
<h1>The Appalachian Trail: 5 weeks</h1>
<p>
I hiked 380 miles from Mount Katahdin at the northernmost point of the trail
to Lincoln, New Hampshire. Right after the Whites.

<p>
I thoroughly enjoyed hiking on the AT.
I started in the middle of the southbound "bubble", when most of the southbound
thru-hikers started. Ryan, my friend since we were small children,
joined me for the first hundred miles of the trail. The "bubble" of southbound
hikers formed a moving community. You always knew the hikers within a day
or so. There were logs in the shelters that people would leave messages in.
</p>

<p>
I want to go back to finish it someday, hopefully in just a few sections.

<h4>Katahdin</h4>
We summitted in some gnarly weather. To be honest, we probably shouldn't have
been up there.  The rocks were wet, the rain was coming in sideways, and the
wind was gusting so strongly it nearly knocked us over multiple times. I have
very few pictures from the hike up because I was focused on not dying,
something I figured my phone could distract me from. But we did it! and we all
lived to tell the tale.

<h4>The Hundred Mile Wilderness</h4>
Abol bridge is the last piece of civilization before you plunge into the 100
mile wilderness. It's a campsite with a few cabins and a general
store about 15 miles from Katahdin and they sell pizza. That pizza
was my last real meal for 10 days and 100 miles.

<p>
Trail Names: On the trail, you don't use your real name. You are given a name
by your companions, usually when you do something really stupid. I made my
mistake the day before we started hiking, but I didn't realize it until I tried
to make dinner. Standing in the bulk food section of the grocery store, Ryan
and I were making trail mix. I saw rice while I was there, thought, "I need
rice" and put some in a bag. Continued shopping without thinking much of it.
The first time I try to cook it, I keep checking on it, to find it crunchy. 30
minutes should be enough, right?  Nope. Okay I'll wait 10 more. Still crunchy?
O. Shit. IT'S NON-INSTANT RICE! Specifically, long grain brown rice. It took
more than an hour to cook and I never ate non-crunchy rice.
</p>

<p>
On my second night on the trail, we walked up to the first shelter of the 100
mile wilderness. There were quite a few people there, so I hung my hammock and
started cooking dinner. There were two hilarious guys from New York. They were
comedic geniouses who could really build off of each other. Everybody else
finished eating dinner and I was still attempting to cook my rice. The New
Yorkers cracked a joke, calling me "GrainMan" and it stuck. On the Applachian
Trail, I am known as GrainMan.
</p>

<p>
After about 5 days of crunchy undercooked rice I got lucky. Another hiker
decided she was done and bailed. She gave me the rest of her instant food
and took some trash to town for us. Thanks again, Missy!
</p>

<h4>Monson, Maine. Heaven on earth</h4>
O. My. God. Monson Maine is the best place ever. It has like 4 restaurants and
I ate at all of them! Pete's Place for breakfast (get the hiker special!).

<p>
On our last day in the 100 mile wilderness we camped about 3 miles outside of
Monson. That morning, we got up early, skipped breakfast and BOOKED IT for
town. And boy was it rewarding. When I reached the road I shouted and
celebrated. FOOD REAL FOOD SOON! So, we hitched into town and got bunks at
Shaw's. Shaw's is my favorite hostel from the AT. It had such a homey
atmosphere. Poet and Hippy Chick were so welcoming and friendly. Also, the
blueberry pancakes and bacon for breakfast were AMAZING.
</p>

<p>
So, we zero'd in Monson. Eating, sleeping, resting, gaining weight, and basking
in the glory that is a zero day. It feels so amazing to replenish your strength
after pushing yourself to exhaustion.

<h4>The Hiker Hut</h4>

<p>
The hiker hut was the most spiritually replenishing place I stayed. I was
actually planning on hitching further into town but I couldn't get a hitch.
I'm so happy I chose to walk to The Hiker Hut because it was so relaxed
and welcoming. I showered outdoors with heated (!) water from the river.
We sat around the campfire and ate popcorn. The people there were communal
and happy :)
</p>


<h4>The Mahoosucks (sp?)</h4>
I don't care how you're actually supposed to spell that mountain range because
it SUCKED. This is the last mountain range in Maine before you cross into New
Hampshire. It was rainy and the trail decided to go directly up granite slabs.
No switchbacks, just straight up a slick slab of rock with a moderately heavy
pack on your back. I surely fell a few times. The mahoosuck notch is known as
the most difficult (and possibly most fun) mile of the trail.
The notch is basically a boulder field. You have to squeeze through, climb
over, and climb under rocks.  It was surely not fun for me. Mostly because I'm
an idiot who chose to hike it in the rain, alone, and right at dusk. Multiple
times I thought it was over and I would be done, but the trail plunged right
back down into that rocky ravine.

<h4>Crossing into New Hampshire</h4>

<h4>The Whites</h4>
Everyone warned me about the whites. They said it would be cold. They said it
would be difficult and rocky. They said the exposed peaks would be dangerous.
It really wasn't that bad. Surely easier than the 100 mile wilderness. You want
to know why? It's simple. I could buy a bowl of soup almost every day for a
dollar. There are Huts up in the whites and they will feed thru-hikers for
cheap. You can also do a "work for stay" which means you work for an hour or
two (sweeping, cleaning, etc.) and they feed you dinner and breakfast and
let you sleep on the floor!

<h4>The rewards of the grueling walk</h4>
It's the simple things. The AT teaches you how valuable the most basic things
are. Food, Warmth, Shelter. I cannot put into words the sheer joy one single
hot meal of pho was for me. That pho got me through the last two grueling
uphill miles in the rain. I knew, at the top of this hill, was a shelter
and I knew that in my bag was a dehydrated pho soup that would taste utterly
amazing. And it did! Not because the food was particularly tasty, but rather
it was exactly what my body needed.

<p>
The AT teaches you what you really need. It strips
you of anything you only want, forcing you to learn what you really need.
Anything you want is too heavy. Don't bring it.

<p>
Living in the woods was wonderful and beautiful.
