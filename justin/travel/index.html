<h1>My travels between graduation and my first job</h1>
I was fortunate enough to have about 7 months to travel. This is how I spent it.
<h1>The Appalachian Trail: 5 weeks</h1>
<p>
I hiked 380 miles from Mount Katahdin at the northernmost point of the trail
to Lincoln, New Hampshire. Right after the Whites.

I want to go back to finish it someday, hopefully in just a few sections.

<h4>Katahdin</h4>
We summitted in some gnarly weather. To be honest, we probably shouldn't have
been up there.  The rocks were wet, the rain was coming in sideways, and the
wind was gusting so strongly it nearly knocked us over multiple times. I have
very few pictures from the hike up because I was focused on not dying,
something I figured my phone could distract me from. But we did it! and we all
lived to tell the tale.

<h4>The Hundred Mile Wilderness</h4>
Abol bridge is the last piece of civilization before you plunge into the 100
mile wilderness. It's a campsite with a few cabins and a general
store about 15 miles from Katahdin and they sell pizza. That pizza
was my last real meal for 10 days and 100 miles.

<p>
Trail Names: On the trail, you don't use your real name. You are given a name
by your companions, usually when you do something really stupid. I made my
mistake the day before we started hiking, but I didn't realize it until I tried
to make dinner. Standing in the bulk food section of the grocery store, Ryan
and I were making trail mix. I saw rice while I was there, thought, "I need
rice" and put some in a bag. Continued shopping without thinking much of it.
The first time I try to cook it, I keep checking on it, to find it crunchy. 30
minutes should be enough, right?  Nope. Okay I'll wait 10 more. Still crunchy?
O. Shit. IT'S NON-INSTANT RICE! Specifically, long grain brown rice. It took
more than an hour to cook and I never ate non-crunchy rice.

On my second night on the trail, we walked up to the first shelter of the 100
mile wilderness. There were quite a few people there, so I hung my hammock and
started cooking dinner. There were two hilarious guys from New York. They were
comedic geniouses who could really build off of each other. Everybody else
finished eating dinner and I was still attempting to cook my rice. The New
Yorkers cracked a joke, calling me "GrainMan" and it stuck. On the Applachian
Trail, I am known as GrainMan.

<h4>The rewards of the grueling walk</h4>
It's the simple things. The AT teaches you how valuable the most basic things
are. Food, Warmth, Shelter. I cannot put into words the sheer joy one single
hot meal of pho was for me. That pho got me through the last two grueling
uphill miles in the rain. I knew, at the top of this hill, was a shelter
and I knew that in my bag was a dehydrated pho soup that would taste utterly
amazing. And it did! Not because the food was particularly tasty, but rather
it was exactly what my body needed.

The AT teaches you what you really need. It strips
you of anything you only want, forcing you to learn what you really need.
Anything you want is too heavy. Don't bring it.

<p>
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed hiking on the AT.
I started in the middle of the southbound "bubble", when most of the southbound
thru-hikers started. Ryan, my friend since we were small children,
joined me for the first hundred miles of the trail.
